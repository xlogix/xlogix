:wave: Hi there. I’m Abhishek, a pragmatic programmer passionate about emerging technologies like biomimetics, biocomputing, MR/VR/AR, and Web3. Since childhood, technology has fascinated me, and I've been tinkering with things. ⚡ Throughout my journey, I've always sought to push boundaries and explore new perspectives. I believe that real progress happens when we challenge the status quo. 

I like to work on products born out of big ideas. I enjoy building scalable systems and products that make a real-world impact. I am interested in distributed systems and system design, so I work on full-stack development and product engineering.

As a former founder and early-stage employee, I’ve worn many hats—from building products and recruiting to marketing and partnerships. I’m always curious to learn and experiment, continuously improving my skill set.

Besides building software, I like to do research and dive into YouTube. I built @fnplus and organized workshops, hackathons, and virtual events to help students develop their technical skills by building projects in the best possible learning environment powered by the community!

Building for everyone involves being aware of different perspectives, so I like to bounce ideas off people and get their opinions. I get excited talking about tech, startups, entrepreneurship, music, science, space, video games, food, travel, and conspiracy theories. Feel free to reach out :)
